Description: A simple wrapper around the 'ical.js' library executing 
    'Javascript' code via 'V8' (the 'Javascript' engine driving the 'Chrome' 
    browser and 'Node.js' and accessible via the 'V8' R package). 
    This package enables users to parse 'iCalendar' files ('.ics', '.ifb', 
    '.iCal', '.iFBf') into lists and 'data.frames' to ultimately do statistics
    on events, meetings, schedules, birthdays, and the like.
