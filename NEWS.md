- adding RRULE fields 
- adding not officially supported and experimental `caldav_get_all_simple_auth()` function
  to retrieve ICAL-data from CalDav servers via simple authentification


# ical 0.1.8 -- 2019-08-18

* fix: ical_parse would return valid timestamps when encountering missing 
  timestamps in data - now it returns NA, as should be expected
* minor: ical_parse_df() now returns character vectors instead of factors
* `ical_parse()` now returns many more fields: priority, class, transp, dtstamp
* by default calendar items containing only empty rows are filtered out within 
  normal parsing function


# ical 0.1.7 -- 2019-07-17

* St√©phane Trainel <stephane.trainel@gmail.com> made `ical_parse()` return 
  location field as well
